    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/euVyBKNfxkk/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Photo of finished Korean Army Stew">
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This dish was invented after the Korean war (1950-1953) when the American army was stationed in the 
        city of Uijeongbu, near Seoul. They had their own food on the base, things like canned beans, meat, 
        Spam, ham, and sausages. This food was totally new to Koreans. Eventually these ingredients made 
        their way into surrounding area of the base and some creative Koreans made stew from them. They 
        boiled spam, ham, sausages, and baked beans with kimchi, garlic, and hot pepper paste and flakes, 
        creating a Korean-style stew with American ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Prepare Stock:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the water, anchovies, mushrooms, and kelp in a large pot. Cover and cook for 25 
                minutes over medium high heat. Add the pork and cook for another 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the pot from the heat. Take out the anchovies, kelp and mushrooms. Slice the 
                    mushrooms into bite size pieces.</li>
                    <li>Strain the mixture of the stock and the pork into a large bowl. Put the pork into 
                        a small bowl. You will get about 6 cups of stock. Stir in the salt until dissolved.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Make Seasoning Paste:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>    Combine the seasoning paste ingredients – garlic, hot pepper paste, hot pepper flakes, soy 
                sauce, sugar, and water in a bowl. Mix well.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Arrange the Ingredients (shallow pot):</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the cabbage, onion, green onion, pork, and the mushrooms, on the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the kimchi, and the seasoning paste over top.</li>
            <li>Add the spam, sausage, rice cake, tofu, baked beans, and cheese.</li>
            <li>Add the ramyeon and the sweet potato starch noodles.</li>
            <li>Put radish sprouts on top and add 3 cups of stock.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Cook and Serve:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook over medium high heat. Korean style is to cook at the table with a portable burner. 
                Friends and family will be sitting around the pot, talking and laughing, and maybe drinking. 
                You can take a bit of cooked sausage or the meat with your chopsticks as you wait for the 
                broth to boil and the noodles to soften. If you don’t have a tabletop burner, you can cook 
                it on the stove away from the table.</li>
                <li>When it starts boiling about 10 minutes later, stir and turn the ingredients over with 
                    tongs to cook evenly.</li>
                    <li>Serve right after the noodles and ramyeon have softened. Transfer some cooked stew 
                        to individual bowls and serve. Add more stock as the broth boils down.</li>
        </ol>
