    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Goat cheese is baked with marinara sauce and topped with fresh basil to make this super easy 
        appetizer in a flash! Serve fresh out of the oven with crostini or garlic bread for dipping.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) goat cheese log
                </li>
                <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon kosher or sea salt (optional)
                    </li>
               <li>¼ cup fresh basil, cut into ribbons
                </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
                <li>Press goat cheese to fit the shape of a small baking dish, leaving a 1-inch border 
                    around the edge. Gently spoon marinara sauce around the border, taking care to cover 
                    the edge of goat cheese but not the middle. Sprinkle with salt. </li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until goat cheese is hot and soft and marinara sauce 
                        is hot and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. </li>
                        <li>Remove from the oven and sprinkle with freshly chopped basil. </li>
        </ol>
